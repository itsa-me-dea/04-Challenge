## Description

My goal was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. Utilizing web APIs, this code is meant to dynamically update the HTML and CSS through JavaScript.

I learned a great deal about the capabilities of JavaScript and how to use web APIs to create a responsive webpage. On top of solidifying what was originally learned with JavaScript, I learned more on how to use DOM manipulation, `addEventListener`, local storage, and more.

## Installation

No installation is required. See the following link to access the website: https://itsa-me-dea.github.io/04-Challenge-CodeQuiz/

## Usage

To use the site, click the "start quiz" button and answer the following questions. 

Clicking the correct answer will notify correct, while incorrect answers will notify incorrect. Note: incorrect answers dock 20 seconds from your time / score.

Once you reach the end or if you run out of time, you will be given your score. From there, you can enter you initials / name and use the enter key or click "submit" to add your score to the local storage.

You can select the try "try again" button to go back to the landing page and see your highscore. 

<!-- Selecting the "clear" button will clear you local storage and highscore(s). -->
